# MosqMicrobiome_Paper
The data presented in the manuscript “Relative Contributions of Various Endogenous and Exogenous Factors on Mosquito Microbiota” by Bogale et al. was analyzed using the pipeline presented here.

The data analysis includes four individual pipelines presented here in different Rmd files. All the custom scripts and files containing primer sequences are presented in the respective “Scripts” and “Primers” folders. The purpose of this document is to facilitate repeatability and dissemination of the methods used in the paper. Note however, that adapting the individual pipelines or scripts might be necessary depending on the data input and desired output of the user. Proficiency with Unix, perl, and R programming languages is recommended. Please contact me through this repository or via email at haikelnb@gmail.com for questions on any portion of this document.

Best wishes, Haikel
